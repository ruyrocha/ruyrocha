# Howdy ðŸ‘‹

Welcome! I'm Ruy[^1], I love Ruby, and I like the software I write can have a
great impact on people's lives.

I'm a former Systems Engineer/Linux Systems Administrator (pre DevOps era). I
switched careers into software engineering on 2013, and since then I'm working
with American companies, and using Ruby On Rails.

## What Am I Looking For?

I'm passionate about heavy data, good amount of daily active users, and
astonishing numbers of requests per second.

I want to assist you with fixing production issues in a timely manner with
proper observability.

I want to improve your poor performant queries and endpoints.

I want to spend little to not time in Figma, writing React components nor using
Tailwind CSS.

While being an individual contributor, I want to polish my management and
leadership skills when there are room to improve them.

I want to pair and mentor junior engineers - except if they're working two or
three jobs at the same time, as it sounds unfair.

    I'm Brazilian, and I didn't know my name may be something weird in certain
    cultures or languages. Given that said, I'm thinking about using **Ray** or
    **Roy** as my English name.
